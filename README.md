Below are the steps to get your plugin running. You can also find instructions at:

This plugin template uses Typescript and NPM, two standard tools in creating JavaScript applications. It also relies on React and Vite for the plugin UI.

First, download Node.js which comes with NPM. This will allow you to install TypeScript and other
libraries. You can find the download link here:

  https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Next, install TypeScript using the command:

  npm install -g typescript

Finally, in the directory of your plugin, get the latest type definitions for the plugin API by running:

  npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings

If you are familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript will look very familiar. In fact, valid JavaScript code
is already valid Typescript code.

TypeScript adds type annotations to variables. This allows code editors such as Visual Studio Code
to provide information about the Figma API while you are writing code, as well as help catch bugs
you previously didn't notice.

Using TypeScript requires a compiler to convert TypeScript (code.ts) into JavaScript (code.js)
for the browser to run.

We recommend writing TypeScript code using Visual Studio code:

1. Download Visual Studio Code if you haven't already: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
2. Open this directory in Visual Studio Code.
3. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Run the "Terminal > Run Build Task..." menu item,
    then select "npm: watch". You will have to do this again every time
    you reopen Visual Studio Code.

That's it! Visual Studio Code will regenerate the JavaScript file every time you save.

### Building the plugin UI with Vite

If you are using React and Vite for the UI, run the build command before testing the plugin in Figma:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

The `npm run build` command compiles `code.ts` and bundles the React UI into the `dist/` folder. Figma reads `dist/index.html` as specified in `manifest.json`. If this file doesn't exist, Figma shows "an error occurred while loading the plugin environment" when you try to run the plugin.
